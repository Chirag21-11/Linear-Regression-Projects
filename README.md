Project 1: Linear Regression with USA_Housing Dataset
Overview
This project aims to predict housing prices based on various features using linear regression. The USA_Housing dataset contains information about housing prices, such as average area income, average area house age, average area number of rooms, average area number of bedrooms, and the area population.

Steps:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Load the dataset.
Explore the features and target variable (housing prices).
Handle missing values and outliers.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Linear Regression Model:
Train a linear regression model using the features.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).
Results and Interpretation:
Interpret the coefficients.
Make predictions on the test set.
Visualize the predicted vs. actual housing prices.
Project 2: Linear Regression with Ecommerce Customers Dataset
Overview
In this project, weâ€™ll analyze the Ecommerce Customers dataset to understand customer behavior and predict future sales. The dataset includes information such as time spent on the website, time spent on the app, length of membership, and yearly amount spent.

Steps:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Load the dataset.
Explore the features and target variable (yearly amount spent).
Handle missing values and outliers.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Linear Regression Model:
Train a linear regression model using relevant features.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).
Insights and Recommendations:
Interpret the coefficients.
Identify key factors influencing customer spending.
Provide recommendations for improving customer engagement.
Feel free to adapt these steps to your specific projects. Good luck! ðŸš€
