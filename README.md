# Linear Regression Projects

This repository contains two projects that utilize linear regression to analyze and predict data. The projects are based on two different datasets: `Ecommerce Customers` and `USA_Housing`.

## Project Overview

### 1. Ecommerce Customers

This project focuses on a dataset of Ecommerce customer data for a company's online platform and in-store style advice sessions. The goal is to understand customer behavior and to maximize yearly spend per customer.

#### Dataset Features

- Email: Customer's email id
- Address: Customer's home address
- Avatar: Avatar chosen by the customer
- Avg. Session Length: Average session time in minutes
- Time on App: Time spent on the app in minutes
- Time on Website: Time spent on the website in minutes
- Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member

### 2. USA_Housing

The USA_Housing project involves a dataset of housing prices across the United States. The aim is to create a model that can predict housing prices based on several features.

#### Dataset Features

- Avg. Area Income: Average income of residents in the city house is located
- Avg. Area House Age: Average age of houses in same city
- Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Average number of rooms in houses in same city
- Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Average number of bedrooms in houses in same city
- Area Population: Population of the city where the house is located
- Price: Price of the house
- Address: Address of the house

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the necessary libraries and tools
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks

## Results and Conclusion

The results of these projects provide valuable insights into customer behavior and housing prices. The linear regression models built were able to predict with a reasonable level of accuracy.

Please refer to the individual Jupyter notebooks for a detailed analysis and breakdown of the models.

## Future Work

Future work on these projects could involve refining the models with more data, trying different regression models, and tuning the parameters of the current models for better performance.
